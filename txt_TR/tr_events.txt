First I have some personal business to finish but after that you can count on me for whatever you want.<br><br>Before you go, accept these magic shards and this sapphire that powered the owl guardian.

e_sen27_a_rp0_s=You attack.

e_sen27_a_rp1_s=You run like never before and after a while you leave the bandit camp behind.<br><br>You hear Yogger stopping the chase and yelling at his men asking them for your head.

e_sen27_a_rp2_s=(Yogger) "Well well well... if it isn't Captain Magnus in flesh, do you think your fancy words would change me?<br><br>I see you're still as foolish as ever... you don't seem to remember who gave you that scar. This time I will kill you and take The Wolfslayer with me."<br><br>Fortunately, you had time to prepare for combat while he spoke.
e_sen27_a_rp3=You bastard, I'll cleanse this forest of you and your werewolf gang!
e_sen27_a_rp3_s=(Yogger) “Brave words, for someone so young...<br><br>Now that I think about it... about ten years ago I killed someone like you who said the same words to me. I guess history repeats itself.<br><br>This forest is mine now and always will be!".<br><br>Yogger charges at you, luckily Bree was careful and placed the group in an advantageous position for the fight.

e_sen27_b_rp5_s=(Yogger) "You finally accept your fate and come to me, Ottis.<br><br>On top of that, you've put on weight in the last few years... lucky me."<br><br>The bait is successful and you hit Yogger in the back of the head while he is distracted by Ottis. The blow isn't hard enough to knock him out, but he looks dazed and weak.
e_sen27_b_rp5_f=(Yogger) "You finally accept your fate and come to me, Ottis.<br><br>On top of that, you've put on weight in the last few years... lucky me.

e_sen30_a_dsc=You arrive at the forest arch that the baker told you and begin to examine the area.<br><br>You notice a small empty stall near the arch and wonder who in their right mind would make a store here.<br><br>Next to it, you see a group of four Trunkies surrounding a hole in the ground that is covered in bushes, you cannot see what is inside it but you see a trail of something that has entered or left the hole.
e_sen30_a_dsca=Defeat the Trunkies to see what's in the hole.

e_sen30_a_rp2=Trunkies are basically living trees... with a fire spell I am sure to disperse them
e_sen30_a_rp2_s=Evelyn cast a fire spell and the Trunkies caught fire, but also the bushes covering the hole.<br><br>If the boy is really in the hole, you don't have any time to waste and must fight the Trunkies right now.
e_sen30_a_rp2_f=Evelyn casts a spell but... that wasn't a "fire spell"... what's more, she didn't even manage to reach the Trunkies with that spell, how disappointing of her.<br><br>The Trunkies get furious after seeing that she tried to burn them and attack you.
e_sen30_a_rp3=I can only see those Trunkies as firewood... let me burn them all!
e_sen30_a_rp3_s=As a fire spellcaster, Cornelius had no trouble reducing the Trunkies to ashes with a powerful spell...<br><br>The problem is that he also incinerated the bushes and surely whatever was in the hole.
e_sen30_a_rp3_f=The spell that Cornelius cast wasn't very powerful, for better or worse only the Trunkies caught fire, they charge at you and the fight begins.

e_sen30_b_rp2=Accuse him of killing the boy, you want a big discount or things will get ugly for him.
e_sen30_b_rp2_s=(Werewolf) "Listen... I'm not afraid of you... and as you can see the boy don't have any bite. I understand that seeing a werewolf alone in the middle of the forest with a corpse of a boy is not very normal...<br><br>I'll give you a good discount, but don't push your luck".<br><br>You got a 30% discount.
e_sen30_b_rp2_sc=(Werewolf) "Listen... I'm not in the mood for a fight and you look pretty strong...<br><br>Given the circumstances I'll give you a good discount and show you my best wares."<br><br>You got a 35% discount.
e_sen30_b_rp2_f=The werewolf growls furiously and says:<br><br>"I've had enough, I'm not going to say it again so leave me alone and go away before I get angry."<br><br>You leave before a fight breaks out.
e_sen30_b_rp2_fc=The werewolf growls furiously and says:<br><br>"I've had enough and it looks like you won't leave me alone... I guess your corpses will be my fault, not like that poor kid."<br><br>The werewolf attacks you.

e_sen30_b_rp4_s=(Werewolf) "Ohh... so it was you who helped my little brother!<br><br>Thank you very much, I will offer you my best products and the biggest discount I can do, my friend."<br><br>You got a 40% discount.
e_sen30_b_rp5=Interesting... seems like a good candidate for my crew.
e_sen30_b_rp5_s=Nezglekt casts a spell on the werewolf and whispers:<br><br>"You can take anything you want from my store."<br><br>The werewolf, who is hypnotized, repeats the phrase. You take advantage of it and take everything you need from the store. Before you leave, Nezglekt takes out a small tadpole and inserts it into the werewolf's eye.
e_sen30_b_rp5_f=Nezglekt casts a spell on the werewolf and whispers:<br><br>"You can take anything you want from my store."<br><br>The werewolf starts to repeat the phrase but realizes what he is saying and stands there thinking. Before he has time to react you leave the place.

e_sen30_b_rp6_s=When the werewolf sees Bree, he quickly packs his things and runs off.<br><br>Luckily for you, in his haste he has left a lot of things from the store that could be useful to you.

e_sen30_c_rp0_s=You cure the child and give him some supplies so that he can return home safely.<br><br>Before leaving, he tells you that he found a chest in the hole and that's why he was there.

e_sen30_c_rp1=He is dead and burned by the fire you caused.
e_sen30_c_rp1_s=The poor kid is burnt to a crisp, you're not sure if he was alive before you burned him... that doesn't change the fact that he's dead.<br><br>Besides the boy, there is a half-burned chest in the hole, that is perhaps the reason why the boy was there. You bury the child and open the chest.<br><br>You told the baker that you would find his son, and you found him... but you are sure that it was not the result he expected when he asked for your help.
e_sen31_a_nm=The moon ritual
e_sen31_a_dsc=You discover a forest glade and here you can see some menhirs placed in a peculiar way and forming a circle, inside the circle there is an altar of some kind in which an elder dryad performs a strange ritual.<br><br>On the altar are some pieces of gold and a shiny white stone that seems to channel the moonlight.<br><br>The dryad has not yet realized that you are close, but it will surely protect the moonstone at all costs.
e_sen31_a_dsca=You can wait for the ritual to end or interrupt it...
e_sen31_a_rp0=Wait for the ritual to end in a safe place and take what may be left.
e_sen31_a_rp0_s=You wait a bit until the moon begins to set, then you see how the dryad takes the stone and leaves.<br><br>Lucky for you she left the gold and some items behind.

e_sen33_a_rp3_fc=The dryad spotted you as you moved carelessly through the forest.<br><br>Furious, she casts a starfall spell on you, and you get burned. You can't rest and your only option is to fight while you're still burning.

e_voidhigh13_a_dsc=You reach the inner sanctum of the obelisk, but it is too late. Any ritual that has been performed here is already over.<br><br>After a quick glance around the room, you can see the body of the princess behind the altar. It seems she is still alive...<br><br>Then your eyes focus on the shadowy figure in front of the altar, it is Lord Hanshek, the brooch on his neck glows brightly and a dark energy emanates from it. He looks at you and gives you a sinister smile.
e_voidhigh13_a_dsca=The moment of truth has come.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp0=I served under you in the Wolf Wars to protect the kingdom, why do you betray it now?
e_voidhigh13_a_rp0_s=(Hanshek) "Tough luck, captain, this is beyond you... Although I suppose I should thank you, since it was you, who in the Wolf Wars helped me recover this gem.<br><br>After extensive research I discovered that with the gem and the blood of an Architects, I could have a power greater than Queen Amelia herself. Who turned out to be a descendant of the Architects.<br><br>Unfortunately the queen has always been out of my reach, but not the princess...<br><br>Now, at last, that power is mine!"
e_voidhigh13_a_rp1=Beep... I must protect friends, beep... I must rescue princess
e_voidhigh13_a_rp1_s=(Hanshek) "Interesting... I never thought I'd see an active war golem again...<br><br>The same power with which the queen created and fueled the golems is mine now. It seems that his power source has been altered and is no longer what it was... so it's of no use to me.<br><br>I'll have to destroy it, along with the rest of you".
e_voidhigh13_a_rp2=I already imagine the feast of fish and beer, grrr... you there, give us back the princess!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp2_s=(Hanshek) "So, you're just a simpleton who comes looking for a reward?<br><br>Well then, if you're looking for an early death that's what you'll get.<br><br>Time to test my new powers!".
e_voidhigh13_a_rp3=You are the one who activated Senenthia's Obelisk, corrupting the forest and my friend Ylmer!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp3_s=(Hanshek) "Mmm... Ylmer? You mean that old tree in the Senenthia forest? That poor tree was already in a deep sleep and half dead when I passed by.<br><br>Activating the Obelisks was a necessary means to reach the void and complete my objective. The corruption coming out of them that you saw in the forest will also gradually take over all the realms...<br><br>Rest assured you won't be here to see it!".
e_voidhigh13_a_rp4=You always struck me as a despicable guy, looks like I won a bet with my brother
e_voidhigh13_a_rp4_s=(Hanshek) "Well, if not the youngest of the Casthaks, always hiding in the woods and meddling in matters that are none of his business.<br><br>How ironic, you almost foiled my plans in the past... you were lucky that your family's great influence and your brother convinced me... otherwise I would have taken care of you by now.<br><br>Well boy, this isn't Senenthia... and it's time to test my new power!"
e_voidhigh13_a_rp5=Sss... I usually only kill for work... sss... but this time I'm going to enjoy it
e_voidhigh13_a_rp5_s=(Hanshek) "What an inferior creature... you cannot comprehend the magnitude of what has happened here and the powers I have just gained.<br><br>I would tell you to go back to your swamp... but this is a perfect opportunity to test my new powers"
e_voidhigh13_a_rp6=You! You're the one to blame for bringing that thing back, freezing all my people!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp6_s=(Hanshek) "What are you talking about? I just activated the obelisk and went on my way.<br><br>You elves, always condescending, arrogant and blaming others... You look like a young elf who just came out of the forest and knows nothing about the world.<br><br>Listen young lady, this place and this magic I just obtained predates the elves and is much more powerful. It's a shame... but you won't be able to go back to your forest."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp7=So you're the bad guy in my epic tale? This battle will be legendary, it's showtime!
e_voidhigh13_a_rp7_s=(Hanshek) "And what are you supposed to be, a singing frog? What a joke.<br><br>I don't have time for this nonsense... but your companions seem to be a threat, so I'll have to finish you off with my new powers."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp8=We grew up together, you were like a big brother... Why did you kidnap the princess?
e_voidhigh13_a_rp8_s=(Hanshek) "Evelyn, you should know better than anyone... Queen Amelia's great magic power was not normal.<br><br>I always wanted that power for myself and after long years of study and this gem, I discovered that the queen was a descendant of the architects and magic ran through her ancient blood.<br><br>The queen was never within my reach, but a few days ago, on her anniversary, the princess awakened that same power. So I took the opportunity to bring her to this ancient place and with a ritual, take away her power."
e_voidhigh13_a_rp9=Seeking power at all costs will do you no good... but fear not, my flames will consume your darkness.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp9_s=(Hanshek) "Hypocritical words coming from the summoner of demons and founder of the Burning Hand...<br><br>You may have had a lot of power in your prime that could've easily taken me down, but now you're just a decrepit old man and your flames are no longer a threat.<br><br>Prepare to succumb to a power greater than you've ever had!".
e_voidhigh13_a_rp10=What an interesting place, can you explain what ritual you did to document it?
e_voidhigh13_a_rp10_s=(Hanshek) "I never expected to meet a gnome here of all places... and that flying machine also caught my eye, maybe I'll keep it when I'm done with you.<br><br>As for the ritual, it's all thanks to this gem and the blood of the princess, a direct descendant of the architects... but someone who is about to die doesn't need to know anything else".
e_voidhigh13_a_rp11=Interesting dark magic you've obtained... but you're a fool and you'll find out soon enough
e_voidhigh13_a_rp11_s=(Hanshek) "You're just a rat, how can you presuppose that your knowledge of dark magic is greater than mine?<br><br>I will show you the great dark power I have obtained and how insignificant you are in comparison".
e_voidhigh13_a_rp12=I thought we were friends, I respected you... what have you done to the princess?
e_voidhigh13_a_rp12_s=(Hanshek) "Reginald, I have always held you in high esteem. You were one of the few I could have a normal conversation with in Senenthia.<br><br>But ever since I saw the queen's great powers, I wanted that power for myself. Now, thanks to this gem and the blood of the princess, that power is mine.<br><br>The princess is only unconscious, but I'm afraid now I have to finish you off old friend...".
e_voidhigh13_a_rp13=Oink... I can feel that gem you're wearing is bad news... you should get rid of it.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp13_s=(Hanshek) "You ignorant swine! This gem is the source of my new power and neither you nor anyone else will separate me from it.<br><br>I will show you how I am the only one who can bring out its full potential and I will finish you".
e_voidhigh13_a_rp14=It's too late for you... you're cursed and being controlled by that gem.
e_voidhigh13_a_rp14_s=(Hanshek) "Speak for yourself... What can a swamp witch like you know about curses when she doesn't see the truth about herself?<br><br>This gem is the source of a power you cannot comprehend, but rest assured I will now show you what it is capable of".
e_voidhigh13_a_rp15=After seeing the destruction that power has caused to this place... you foolish human...
e_voidhigh13_a_rp15_s=(Hanshek) "Don't try to get into my mind, squid! It is futile, I know what you are.<br><br>A race that travels worlds and planes at ease, only to steal the relics from their inhabitants to sell elsewhere is no less foolish.<br><br>I will show you what we are capable of!"

e_voidhigh6_a_nm=The colored runes
e_voidhigh6_a_dsc=You arrive at some strange circular ruins, in the center you can see a magic circle and around it you see twelve plates.

e_voidhigh6_a_rp4_s=When you press the last rune, the magic circle lights up and a strange energy emanates from it.<br><br>As Tsenemo told you, you place yourself in the center and take the opportunity to meditate.<br><br>When you finish the meditation you feel relaxed and with more energy to start the next fights. (Initial energy +1)
e_voidhigh6_a_rp5=As the demon summoning guide says, you press black, orange and red.
e_voidhigh6_a_rp5_s=When you press the last rune, the magic circle lights up and a demon from hell is summoned.<br><br>The demon does not seem hostile. It approaches you and offers you an ancient artifact of incredible quality.<br><br>Furthermore, he bows to you and offers to serve you if you accept him.
e_voidhigh6_a_rp6=As the innkeeper at the Happy Owl told you, you press green, yellow and blue.

e_voidlow16_a_dsca=So unless you have the key you settle for the rest of the treasure.
e_voidlow16_a_rp0=You search in the treasure and take as much as you can.

e_voidlow25_a_rp2=As Tsnemo told you, you make sure to prepare your holy defenses.
e_voidlow25_a_rp2_s=Before the combat starts, you make sure to cast a spell of protection against holy damage and rest for a while.
e_voidlow25_b_nm=The twins fall
e_voidlow25_b_dsc=After a hard fight you have defeated the two colossal automatons and the way to the stairs is clear.<br><br>Before you start the ascent you notice that on one side of the tower there is a large ancient chest.

e_voidlow5_a_dsc=You arrive at some ruins where it seems that many battles have been fought. To move forward there are only two paths and each one is protected by an army of constructs.<br><br>To the north is the white army and to the south is the black army.

e_voidlow5_a_rp1_s=You decide to face the black army, the fight begins.
e_voidlow6_a_nm=The white statue
e_voidlow6_a_dsc=After defeating the constructs you find a large white statue, when you examine it you see that it has a keyhole in the center.<br><br>The magic bridge that connects the ruins seems to be weakened. You imagine that somehow the statue serves to reactivate it and access the central ruins, otherwise it would be impossible to get there.<br><br>Luckily there is another path that would allow you to move forward, but it leads you away from the central ruins.
e_voidlow6_a_dsca=The only way to continue to the center is to have the key or somehow pick the lock.
e_voidlow6_a_rp0=You are leaving since you don't have the key.
e_voidlow6_a_rp0_s=As there is nothing you can do, you take the other path.
e_voidlow6_a_rp1=You use the white key in the lock.
e_voidlow6_a_rp1_s=The key works perfectly and you hear a click. Then, you see how the magic bridge is reactivated at full power.<br><br>You can now move towards the center.
e_voidlow6_a_rp2=You try to pick the lock somehow.
e_voidlow6_a_rp2_s=Incredibly after tinkering with the lock for a while you hear a click. Then, you see how the magic bridge is reactivated at full power.<br><br>You can now move towards the center.

Then, you see how the magic bridge is reactivated at full power.<br><br>You can now move towards the center.<br><br>In addition you have opened a secret compartment of the statue in which you have found quite a few magic shards.
e_voidlow6_a_rp2_f=After tinkering with the lock for a while, nothing useful happens and you have no choice but to leave rather disappointed.
e_voidlow6_a_rp2_fc=After tinkering with the lock for a while, you hear a click... but something is wrong... suddenly, the statue discharges a strong electric current that electrocutes you.
e_voidlow6_a_rp3=Sss... I can try to pick the lock
e_voidlow6_a_rp3_s=Thuls pulls out a lock pick and manages to pick the lock. You see how the magic bridge is reactivated at full power.<br><br>You can now move towards the center.
e_voidlow6_a_rp3_f=Thuls pulls out a lock pick but fails to pick the lock, Thuls feels a bit humiliated and you have no choice but to leave.
e_voidlow6_a_rp4=Well, just this once... you can get on
